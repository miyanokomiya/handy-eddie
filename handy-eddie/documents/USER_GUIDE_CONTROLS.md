# Using Media and Arrow Controls

## Quick Start

### Enabling Controls

1. Open the mobile app and connect to your server
2. Tap the **Settings** (??) icon in the top-right corner
3. Toggle the switches:
   - **Media Controls** - For play/pause, volume, and track navigation
   - **Arrow Key Controls** - For keyboard arrow keys (useful for YouTube, games, etc.)
4. Tap **Done**

The control panels will appear/disappear immediately based on your settings.

## Media Controls

Located just above the mouse buttons, the Media Controls panel provides:

### Playback Row
- **Previous** (?) - Skip to previous track or rewind
- **Play/Pause** (???) - Toggle playback (large center button)
- **Next** (?) - Skip to next track or forward

### Volume Row
- **Volume Down** (???) - Decrease system volume
- **Mute** (??) - Toggle mute/unmute
- **Volume Up** (???) - Increase system volume

### Works With
- YouTube, Netflix, and other streaming services
- Spotify, iTunes, and music players
- VLC, Windows Media Player, and video players
- Any app that responds to Windows media keys

## Arrow Key Controls

Located between Media Controls and Mouse Buttons, provides a traditional arrow key layout:

```
    Å™
  Å© Å´ Å®
```

### YouTube Tips
- **Left Arrow**: Rewind 5 seconds
- **Right Arrow**: Forward 5 seconds
- Works when video is focused (not typing in comments)

### Other Uses
- Navigate through image galleries
- Move in games
- Navigate file explorers
- Scroll through documents
- Any app that uses arrow keys

## Tips

- **Save screen space**: Disable controls you don't use frequently
- **Battery saver**: Fewer controls = less scrolling = longer battery life
- **Connection required**: All controls need an active connection to work
- **Grayed out buttons**: Controls are disabled when disconnected
